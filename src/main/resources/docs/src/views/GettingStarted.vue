        <p>We have an example test application that utilises the framework to build tests.</p>
        <p>If you want to get started quickly then, all you need to do is clone that repository.  It'll pull everything you need down and you can get started.</p>
        <p>It's also possible to retrofit your current tests to use this framework.  We're not writing documentation on that subject at the moment, but we're working with a client to go
        through that process and as we learn some of the gotchas we'll write a guide about how you might go about it.</p>
